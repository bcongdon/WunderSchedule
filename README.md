# WunderSchedule
A Node.js module that allows you to 'schedule' tasks to appear in your Wunderlist todos

## Usage
This module is not yet in a state that it would be useful to anyone.
However, if you do want to tinker around with it, you must go to the [Wunderlist Developer Portal](https://developer.wunderlist.com/apps) and register an app.
Then, copy `credentials_template.json` to `credentials.json` in `utils` and add your `client_id` and `access_token` which you've created.

Then, just run `node wunderschedule.js` and something ~~will~~ might happen!
